This repo contains the solutions to all days of Advent of Code (http://adventofcode.com/) in Q.

Q is the language of KDB+, a product by Kx Systems. It is a language from the same family as APL, A+ and J. I chose this language due to the way it allows advanced operations to be compressed into small pieces of code, while remaining readable (compared to APL, J or even K which is the base of Q).

For details on Q please check http://code.kx.com/wiki/Main_Page . The "Reference" section is especially useful to aid with reading complex code.

Selected puzzles have been annotated with details on how the solutions are built up. One criterion for the choice is that they are especially suited to demonstrate the power of the Q language, where it "shines" when compared to commonly used languages like C++, Java or JavaScript. These puzzles are as follows:
Day 3 - Squares With Three Sides
Day 4 - Security Through Obscurity 
Day 6 - Signals and Noise
Day 16 - Dragon Checksum
Day 18 - Like a Rogue
